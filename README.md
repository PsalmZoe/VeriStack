# VeriStack: Decentralized Identity Verification with ZKP

## Overview
VeriStack is a cutting-edge blockchain-based identity verification solution that revolutionizes how personal identity data is managed, verified, and shared across digital services. By leveraging the power of decentralized technology, VeriStack empowers users to take complete control of their identity while ensuring privacy, security, and selective data disclosure.

## Key Features
### üîí User-Controlled Identity
- Complete ownership and control of personal identity data
- No centralized storage of sensitive information
- Users decide what information to share and with whom

### üõ°Ô∏è Decentralized Verification
- Identity verification performed on a blockchain network
- Transparent and tamper-proof verification process
- Eliminates single points of failure and data breach risks

### üîê Granular Access Management
- Fine-grained permission controls for service access
- Temporary and revocable access tokens
- Users can grant or revoke service permissions instantly

### üîç Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Verify claims without revealing sensitive data
- Cryptographic proof of attributes while preserving privacy
- Selective disclosure of verification status to services
- Time-limited validity of claims

### üí° Privacy-First Design
- Minimal personal information exposure
- Cryptographically secure data sharing
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## How It Works
1. **Identity Registration**
   - Users register their decentralized identity (DID)
   - Provide minimal required information
   - No centralized data storage

2. **Verification Process**
   - Authorized verifiers validate user identity
   - Verification status recorded on blockchain
   - Proof of verification without revealing sensitive details

3. **Service Access Management**
   - Users grant time-limited access to services
   - Granular control over data sharing
   - Easy permission revocation

4. **Zero-Knowledge Claims**
   - Register cryptographic claims about attributes
   - Prove possession of verified attributes without revealing them
   - Services can verify specific requirements without accessing personal data

## Technical Architecture
- **Blockchain**: Stacks Blockchain
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Key Components**:
  - Decentralized Identity Registry
  - Service Access Management
  - Verification Tracking
